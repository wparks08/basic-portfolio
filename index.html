          My name is Will Parks. Originally from a small town in Marin County, I
          now live in Orangevale, CA with my Wife and (soon to be born!)
          daughter.

          I first started my life-long career with computers at around the age
          of 4, when I built my first computer (with supervision, of course!). I
          received my first programming book in C in the 4th grade, and have
          been hooked ever since. This led me to study Computer Science in
          college, obtaining a certification in HTML/CSS Web Content
          Development, and an Associates of Science in Computer Science.
